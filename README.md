# .zshrc

zshrc files (for MacOS or other Zsh environments) are both files on your local system used to create aliases, which are like keyboard shortcuts for your shell or terminal. Zshrc is more in-depth as it can not only be used to set aliases but can also include setup scripts and default environment variables.
